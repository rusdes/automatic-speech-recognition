# Project: DNN Speech Recognizer

A deep neural network that functions as part of an end-to-end automatic speech recognition (ASR) pipeline!

We begin by investigating the LibriSpeech dataset that will be used to train and evaluate the models. First we convert any raw audio to feature representations that are commonly used for ASR. We will then move on to building neural networks that can map these audio features to transcribed text. After implementing the basic types of layers that are often used for deep learning-based approaches to ASR, we will create and test our own state-of-the-art model.
